General
 - Turn start
    - Gain resources from your producers
    - Draw 1 card
 - Turn end: Building cooldown ticks down 

Energy Implementation
 - Each user (Player.PlayerStats)'s energy property tracks the current energy output
 - When a building generates or stops generating energy, the user's energy property is changed accordingly
 - If the user's energy output is ever less than energy usage, their buildings will be deactivated in order of last built

Spawning
  - Units: Can be spawned adjacent to/within 2 spaces of buildings 
    - Spawn with no attacks/moves
  - Buildings: Can be spawned adjacent to units (no diagonals) 
    - Building health starts at 1/(x+1) when placed and gains 1/(x+1) per build tick, where x is total build ticks needed

Units
 - Movement
    - Each unit may be commanded to move once per turn and attack once per turn (unless otherwise specified)
    - The client will send the server an array of steps as a move
    - If a step causes a unit to detect an invisible unit, the unit stops and may be commanded to move again
    - Speed is the number of steps a unit can take each turn. Detecting an invisible unit does not replenish this.
    - Units move taxicab-wise (Up/down/left/right)
 - Range
    - Unit range uses Euclidean distance, from the center of their tile to the center of the target tile
    - Melee units have range 1 or 1.5, depending on whether or not they can target diagonally.
 - Line-of-sight(LOS)
    - Units and buildings block LOS. In the future, some terrain might also do so.
    - Draw line from center of source tile to center of target tile. If the line intersects
      any square that blocks LOS, then LOS is blocked.
       - If the line passes through a corner, then the corner must be blocked on both sides
         in order to block LOS.
 - Sight (for purposes of fog of war, which is not currently implemented)
    - Uses euclidean distance & LOS

Buildings
  - Construction
    - Adjacent units contribute to building construction
    - At the end of each turn, build time ticks down by 1 for each adjacent unit by default (can be modified w/ keywords)

Invisibility (WIP!)
 - Invisible units are hidden and cannot be detected by enemy players
    - They are revealed when within one or two tiles of an enemy unit 
 - If an invisible unit moves into detection range and kills the target, the unit isn't revealed
 - A direction indicator will appear when damage is dealt by an unrevealed invisible unit showing the direction the attack came from
