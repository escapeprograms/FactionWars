Game mechanics
 - Turn end: All of your buildings get -1 building cooldown
 - Turn start: Gain resources from your producers
    - When you don't have enough energy, your buildings start shutting down (latest buildings first)

Energy Implementation
 - Each user (Player.PlayerStats)'s energy property tracks the current energy output
 - When a building generates or stops generating energy, the user's energy property is changed accordingly
 - If the user's energy output is ever less than energy usage, their buildings will be deactivated in order of last built
