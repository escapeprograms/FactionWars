Things to Do, Amongst Others

 - Figure out how to identify sockets. Socket.id is ephemeral, so we shouldn't really use that.
   Edit creation of users after we figure that out.
 - Add game logic and apply proper changes to "disconnect" event
 - Test the new code
- When buildings are activated/disactivated, check for reactivation?
